# WGU-C482-Inventory-Management-System-with-JavaFX

## Overview

The Inventory Management System with JavaFX is a comprehensive and user-friendly application designed to revolutionize inventory management for a small manufacturing organization. The project utilizes the power of IntelliJ IDEA and Scene Builder to develop a modern and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows seamless data entry, manipulation, and retrieval. By replacing the manual spreadsheet-based system, the Inventory Management System aims to optimize inventory control, streamline operations, and enhance productivity for the organization.

## Key Features

### 1. Intuitive GUI with Scene Builder

The application boasts a visually appealing and intuitive GUI, carefully crafted using Scene Builder. Users can easily navigate through various forms, including the Main form, Add Part form, Modify Part form, Add Product form, and Modify Product form. Each form closely adheres to the provided mock-up, providing a familiar and user-friendly interface.

### 2. Object-Oriented Design

Built upon a solid foundation of object-oriented programming, the Inventory Management System incorporates various classes that map to the UML class diagram provided. The design includes inheritance, abstract and concrete classes, and the use of instance and static variables and methods. This ensures flexibility and maintainability while accommodating future enhancements to the application.

### 3. Comprehensive Functionality

The system empowers users with a wide range of functionalities to manage their inventory effectively. Key features include:

- **Add, Modify, and Delete Parts:** Users can add new parts, modify existing part information, and delete unwanted parts, ensuring accurate and up-to-date inventory records.

- **Search and Filter:** The application enables users to search for parts and products by ID or name (partial or full name). It highlights matching results and provides error messages if no match is found, improving data retrieval efficiency.

- **Associate Parts with Products:** Users can associate multiple parts with a product, streamlining the process of creating and updating product information.

- **Input Validation and Error Handling:** The system ensures data integrity by implementing input validation and logical error checks. Users are guided with descriptive error messages in case of any inappropriate data entry.

### 4. Efficient Data Handling

The Inventory Management System efficiently handles data by utilizing nonpersistent in-memory storage. Data resides in computer memory while in use, making the application lightweight and fast.
